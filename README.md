# Prevent Statistical Attack in Simple Substitution in Cryptanalysis 

This project is an implementation of Simple Substitution and Statistical Attack against it, and an innovative way to prevent this attack. <br>
This innovative method works in a way that makes a shift in the dictionary (or, as I called it in the code, the cipherText list) for every transition that happens to a character (except spaces and new lines). <br>
The dictionary (or cipherText list) is only an alphabetical list in descending order. <br>
You can use PlainText.txt as your input and CipherText.txt as your output (that I left as an examples). <br>
Avoid using capital letters and any characters except the alphabet, a space, and a new line. <br>
This project was written in 2021 and developed in Python, and is one of my academic projects.
